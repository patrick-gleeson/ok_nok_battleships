# ok_nok_battleships
A work-in-progress simple command line game to demonstrate ok_noks in action. 

The purpose of this is to demonstrate a not-too-contrived example of how to work with ok_noks. Specifically, to show situations where they are useful, and also to show that even I don't think they're useful everywhere.

To run tests, it's:

    bundle install
    
then:

    bundle exec rspec --color --format doc

or:

    bundle exec cucumber    

To try the game out, it's:

    bundle exec ruby main.rb
